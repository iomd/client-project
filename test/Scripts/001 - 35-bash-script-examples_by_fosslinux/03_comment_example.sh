#3. Use of comment

#While using comments, we use the “#” symbol to add a single line comment in bash scripting. Here, you will create a new file with a simple name such as ‘comment_example’. Include a script with a single comment like the example displayed below.

#!/bin/bash
# Add two values
((sum=30+20))

#thereafter print the result
echo $sum
