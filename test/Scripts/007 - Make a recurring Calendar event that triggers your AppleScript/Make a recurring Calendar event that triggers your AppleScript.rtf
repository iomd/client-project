\f0\fs28 \cf0 ## Make a recurring Calendar event that triggers your AppleScript:\
	- [ ] Save your applescript as an application\
	- [ ] Go to the Calender app and make a new Calender event to run at whatever time and frequency;\
	- [ ] Under the Event settings; change "Alert" settings to "Custom / Open file / at time of event" and choose your Applescript app.\
	- [ ] Make sure you test it at least once so MacOS will "bless" it to run with the correct permissions.\
