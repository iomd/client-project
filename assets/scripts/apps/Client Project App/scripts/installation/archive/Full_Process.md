# script process

## Initial Structure

### Step 2 Create Initial Folders

- [x] `Scripts`
- [x] `Styles`
- [x] `src`
- [x] src/`img`
- [x] src/`video`
- [x] src/`docs`
- [x] src/`audio`
- [x] src/audio/`stems`

### Step 3 Create Initial Files

- [x] src/docs/`sample_cue_points.txt`
- [x] src/docs/`client_email.csv`
- [x] src/docs/`client_notes.csv`
- [x] src/docs/`changelog.log`
- [x] src/docs/`README.md`

## Before Mixing Completed

### Step 4 Send these files to client

- [ ] `client_notes.txt`

### Step 5 Received files from client

- [ ] `client_notes.txt`

## After Mixing Completed

### Step 6 Update these files

- [ ] `client_notes.txt`
- [ ] `changelog.log`
- [ ] `README.md`

### Step 7 Convert these files

- [ ] `final_version.pdf` from `README.md`

### Step 8 Send final files to clients emails

- [ ] `final_version.mp3`
- [ ] `final_version.pdf`

### Step 9 Prepare Stems

#### Stems: Location

- [ ] `src/audio/stems`

#### Stems: Gang of Four

- [ ] Stem #1. **TV** (that’s instrumental plus chorus or background vocals).
- [ ] Stem #2. **Lead Vocal(s)** (plus its reverb of course ---basically muting everything else).
- [ ] Stem #3. **Full Mix** (that’s what I will use unless there is a problem, and it's also a reference to prove that #1 and #2 were made correctly).
- [ ] Stem #4. **Instrumental** (by adding this to #1 we can reduce the chorus level. By subtracting this from #1 we can increase the chorus level. By subtracting this from #3 we can increase lead and chorus. And so on! - Bob Katz

#### Stems: Archive

- [ ] Create `stems_gang_of_four.zip` in `src/audio/stems`
- [ ] Copy `stems_gang_of_four.zip` in `Client Library`
