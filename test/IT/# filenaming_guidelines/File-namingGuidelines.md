# File-naming Guidelines

## Step 1. ==Initial== Look at the Project
- If Project Started with me, continue from Step 2.
- Otherwise, continue from Step 4. 

## Step 2. Recording & Mixing Processes
### ==Before== Recording is Complete
~~~ filename
songTitle v0.0	template
~~~
~~~ filename
songTitle v0.1	instrumental
songTitle v0.2	record
songTitle v0.3	re-record 1
songTitle v0.4	re-record 2
~~
songTitle v0.8	acapella
songTitle v0.9	rough
~~~
- DAW prep
- Recording Session(s)
- Rough mix file Export

## Step 3. My *Vision Of The Project*
### ==After== Recording is Complete 
~~~ filename
songTitle v1.0	mix1
songTitle v1.1	mix1.1
~~
songTitle v1.9	mix1.9
~~~
- At this point I'm only editing from the **recording** of the project to make 
	- arrangements
	- markers
	- personal notes
	- sends
	- group tracks
	- renaming tracks
- This is before receiving `notes` from **The Client**.

## Step 4. Client's Vision Of The Project
~~~ filename
songTitle v2.0	mix2
~~
songTitle v2.9	mix2.9
~~~
~~~ filename
songTitle v3.0	mix3
~~
songTitle v3.9	mix3.9
~~~
~~~ filename
songTitle v4.0	mix4
~~
songTitle v4.9	mix4.9
~~~
- At this point **The Client** should have `notes`. Send **The Client** a `notes` template if available.
- Continue **The Client's** Vision Of The Project for 3 revisions.
- Each incremented file between (#.0 - #.8) is my personal adjustments to make backups after basic DAW prep setup.

## Step 5. Final Version Of The Project
Create an `alias file` of **The Client** *Verified version* of the project named `Final` in not the `[rootPath]/[songTitle]/Final` location, but in the `[rootPath]/Final` location.
