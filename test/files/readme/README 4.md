## Songs Stems

### Gang of Four

#### File List

- [ ] `1_karaoke` : **TV** (that’s instrumental plus chorus or background vocals).
- [ ] `2_ldv` : **Lead Vocal(s)** (plus its reverb of course ---basically muting everything else).
- [ ] `3_fullmix` : **Full Mix** (that’s what I will use unless there is a problem, and it's also a reference to prove that #1 and #2 were made correctly).
- [ ] `4_instrumental` : **Instrumental** (by adding this to #1 we can reduce the chorus level. By subtracting this from #1 we can increase the chorus level. By subtracting this from #3 we can increase lead and chorus. And so on! - Bob Katz
