"**Lemon Pepper Freestyle**" is a song by Canadian rapper [Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)), featuring vocals from American rapper [Rick Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross). It was released as the third out of three tracks from Drake's fourth extended play, [*Scary Hours 2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Hours_2), through [Republic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Records) and [OVO Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound), on March 5, 2021. The two artists wrote the song alongside [Boi-1da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boi-1da), [Coco O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_O.), and [Robin Hannibal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hannibal), while it was produced by Boi-1da and Austin Powerz with uncredited co-production from [FnZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FnZ) and Keanu Beats.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Pepper_Freestyle#cite_note-1) It contains an sample from "Pressure" by [Quadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadron).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Pepper_Freestyle#cite_note-2)

## Background[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lemon_Pepper_Freestyle&action=edit&section=1)]

Before the song was released, Drake and Rick Ross had over fifteen collaborations, including two 2019 singles: "[Money in the Grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_in_the_World_Pack)" by Drake and "[Gold Roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Roses)" by Rick Ross.

Drake reflects on "what it's like going to parent-teacher conferences as a superstar". The song has inspired various people, American professional basketball player [Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo), from the [Milwaukee Bucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks) posted a video of himself eating lemon and pepper wings. American rapper Wynne freestyled over the instrumental of the song.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Pepper_Freestyle#cite_note-3)

## Critical reception[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lemon_Pepper_Freestyle&action=edit&section=2)]

Jordan Rose of [*Variety*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)) felt that the song has Rick Ross "stepping aside after the opening to let Drake go an hour on the beat and deliver one of his most mature verses in recent memory" and Drake "is beyond waxing poetic solely about the things he still wants".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Pepper_Freestyle#cite_note-4)

Drake founded the label in 2012

---

The label's roots can be traced back to 2006, when Drake's first official mixtape, [*Room for Improvement*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_Improvement_(mixtape)), was released under the unofficial record label "All Things Fresh" which eventually became "October's Very Own". Drake later raised the profile of the label by prominently featuring OVO throughout his music, regularly mentioning the label in songs and on stage, as well as promoting OVO merchandise.

The record label was officially founded in 2012 by Drake and long-time collaborators Noah "40" Shebib and Oliver El-Khatib following the success of Drake's third studio album [*Nothing Was the Same*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Was_the_Same). According to [*Billboard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)), Drake signed a partnership deal with [Warner Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Records)similar to that of [Rick Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross)' record company. Though Ross is signed as a solo artist to [Epic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records), the artists on Ross' [Maybach Music Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_Music_Group) label are signed to [Atlantic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records), former partners with Warner.

Drake was signed as a solo artist to [Republic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Records) through [Young Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Money_Entertainment)and [Cash Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Money_Records) for nine years. Drake's 2018 release Scorpion was his last project under Young Money/Cash Money. [2] On the other hand, the artists Drake signs to OVO Sound through Warner have their content distributed through the latter.[3][4]

Upon founding the label in 2012, Drake and 40 signed frequent collaborators [Boi-1da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boi-1da), [T-Minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Minus_(producer)), [Mike Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Zombie) to the label as in-house producers (the latter two are the only active signees in the label to come outside of Canada).[5] In April 2013, it was reported that Drake was close to signing the label's first [recording artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_artist_(occupation)), [PartyNextDoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PartyNextDoor), which he ended up revealing shortly thereafter.[6] In August 2013, Drake announced that he signed Toronto music duo [Majid Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majid_Jordan) to OVO Sound.[7] OB O'Brien and [iLoveMakonnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILoveMakonnen) would soon sign in 2014, with the latter being the first non-Canadian act and second non-Canadian signee after to Mike Zombie. Makonnen would eventually leave OVO Sound in April 2016, wishing to pursue his interests as a solo artist with Warner. Canadian rap artist [Roy Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Woods) and R&B duo [Dvsn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvsn), composed of singer Daniel Daley and producer Nineteen85, soon joined the label in 2015 and 2016, with each act releasing an [EP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play) and studio album respectively.[8][9][10][11] In 2021, Canadian rap artist [Smiley](https://www.ovosound.com/artists#smiley) was signed to the label.[12][13]

### OVO Sound Radio

OVO Sound Radio was a radio program that aired on [Beats 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music), fortnightly on Saturdays. The show primarily aired newer material, with at least one song premiering in each broadcast. The show's initial airing was on July 11, 2015, and it was hosted by Drake and Oliver El-Khatib. The show is notable for debuting hit Drake singles, such as platinum-selling "[Hotline Bling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Bling)", and chart-topping "[One Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Dance)". The show ended on October 27, 2018. On March 4, 2021 Drake announced that he and Oliver would debut their new 24 hour radio station, "SOUND42" on [Sirius XM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM) featuring the return of OVO Sound Radio that same night.[15]

### OVO Clothing

OVO Clothing was launched in 2011.[16] The series of clothing began with a series of collaborations between [Roots Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_Canada) and OVO, which produced several parkas, jackets and other collaborations. In 2013, merchandise for the OVO figurehead included collaborations with the [Toronto Raptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors), which coincided with Drake becoming the franchise's Global Ambassador. OVO has since morphed into a clothing line in itself, releasing a slew of clothes during every season of the year. [T-shirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt), [sweatshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshirt), [varsity jackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_jacket), baseball hats, and knit beanies are seasonal installations. OVO Clothing oversaw the opening of the first OVO store for the brand's clothing in downtown [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto), opening on December 6, 2014.[17] Exactly a year after the opening in Toronto, OVO stores expanded to the United States, opening a [flagship store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_store) in Los Angeles, California. Its New York store opened in December 2016 on [Bond Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_Street_(Manhattan)), and its Chicago store in August 2019 on Walton Street in [Gold Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Historic_District_(Chicago)). OVO also opened its first location in Vancouver in December 2018.[18] Other OVO collaborations have included [Canada Goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose_(clothing)), and [Air Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Jordan).

Its pre-2016 collection was composed of basketball shorts, OVO jerseys, [track jackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_jacket), and baggy hoodies.[19]

On November 9, 2020, it was revealed via the OVO Clothing Instagram account that [NHL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League) [Hall of Famer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame) [Wayne Gretzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky) would be a model for the Fall and Winter 2020 collection.[20] Gretzky and OVO Clothing founder Drake are both proud natives of southern [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario), Canada. Also featured in the collection was former Canadian Olympian [Ross Rebagliati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Rebagliati),[21] who won a gold medal in Giant Slalom Snowboarding in the 1998 Nagano Olympics.
